## Monthly Summary
**What do I want to change going forward?**

**What am I most proud of this month?**

**What gave me the most experiential joy this month?**

## Prompts
**Pick 3-5 of these to answer for the month**

From Tim Ferriss:
**#12 — What might I put in place to allow me to go off the grid for 4 to 8 weeks, with no phone or email?**
**#13 — Am I hunting antelope or field mice?**

**Check in with myself to make sure that I'm not stuck on anything. Ask questions like:**
-   If I were a character in a book, what would my readers be yelling at me to do?
-   Do I want to stop any of my activities (temporarily or permanently)?
-   If you were your successor at work, what would the first 90 days look like for you?
