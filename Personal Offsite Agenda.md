## Ideas for my growth:

## Random Things:

Possible Activity or Considerations:

* Succession plan (from Elegant Puzzle):
  * Review my role:
    * Document my role in: meetings, recurring processes
    * What do different individuals rely on me for?
    * What types of inbound requests do I field regularly?
    * Look at my to-do list, what themes stand out?
    * What relationships am I maintaining externally?
  * Close gaps
    * Who can take on pieces of the above? Which of these are easy/hard?
* What stage are teams in?
  * Forming, storming, norming, performing
  * Falling behind, treading water, repaying debt, innovating
* What are the current problem statements I see in the organization?
	* If someone amazing came into my job today, what things would they find unacceptable?
	* What are some strategies for how I/we can solve these?
	* What actions would support these strategies?
	* What vision (future states) will we be in if we solve these problems?
		* Will Larson (An Elegant Puzzle) suggests vision contains:
		  * Vision Statement - 1-2 sentence aspirational statement
		  * Value Proposition
		  * Capabilities - what do you need in order to get use to the future state?
		  * Solved Constraints - what will be solved in the future?
		  * Future constraints - what will exist in this future?
		  * Reference materials
		  * Narrative - synthesize all of the above into an easy-to-digest summary
