**What am I most proud of this month?**

**What gave me the most experiential joy this month?**

**What I listened to:**

## Prompts
**Pick 3-5 of these to answer for the month**

From Tim Ferriss:
**#1 — What if I did the opposite for 48 hours?**
**#2 — What do I spend a silly amount of money on? How might I scratch my own itch?**
**#3 — What would I do/have/be if I had $10 million? What’s my real TMI?**
**#4 — What are the worst things that could happen? Could I get back here?**
**#5 — If I could only work 2 hours per week on my business, what would I do?**
**#7 — What’s the least crowded channel?**
**#8 — What if I couldn’t pitch my product directly?**
**#11 — What if I could only subtract to solve problems?**
**#12 — What might I put in place to allow me to go off the grid for 4 to 8 weeks, with no phone or email?**
**#13 — Am I hunting antelope or field mice?**
**#14 — Could it be that everything is fine and complete as is?*
**#15 — What would this look like if it were easy?**
**#16 — How can I throw money at this problem? How can I “waste” money to improve the quality of my life?**

**Check in with myself to make sure that I'm not stuck on anything. Ask questions like:**
-   If I were a character in a book, what would my readers be yelling at me to do?
-   Is my business getting me where I need to go?
-   Am I being completely honest with my partner?
-   Do I feel anxious about anything?
-   What nice thing can I do for a friend or partner?
-   How are my finances?
-   Can I do anything to make myself more productive?
-   Am I reading good books?
-   Do I want to stop any of my activities (temporarily or permanently)?
-   Are my friends helping or hindering me?
-   What would I do if I were flagrantly, fearlessly, ignorantly optimistic?
-   If you were to start a competitor, what would it look like?
-   If you were your successor at work, what would the first 90 days look like for you?

## 80/20 Review:

- What 20% of my work activities are providing 80% of the value? Should I modify my schedule accordingly?
- What 20% of my life activities are providing 80% of my happiness? Should I be doing more?
